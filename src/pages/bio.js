          Virginia Cannella is a fibers artist living in Brooklyn, New York. She received a BFA in Art Education from Massachusetts College of Art and Design.
          Her practice as an educator is centered around socially informed pedagogy and culturally responsive public programming.
          Her current creative process centers heavily on examining femininity, aiming to rehearse new ideas for survival through corroborating the digital and the physical as a means of collective healing expressed through weaving, knitting, sewing, and quilting.
